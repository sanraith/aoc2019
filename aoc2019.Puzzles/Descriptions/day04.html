<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part One ---</h2><p>You arrive at the Venus fuel depot only to discover it's protected by a password.  The Elves had written the password on a sticky note, but someone <span title="Look on the bright side - isn't it more secure if nobody knows the password?">threw it out</span>.</p>
<p>However, they do remember a few key facts about the password:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a six-digit number.</li>
<li>The value is within the range given in your puzzle input.</li>
<li>Two adjacent digits are the same (like <code>22</code> in <code>1<em>22</em>345</code>).</li>
<li>Going from left to right, the digits <em>never decrease</em>; they only ever increase or stay the same (like <code>111123</code> or <code>135679</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than the range rule, the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>111111</code> meets these criteria (double <code>11</code>, never decreases).</li>
<li><code>2234<em>50</em></code> does not meet these criteria (decreasing pair of digits <code>50</code>).</li>
<li><code>123789</code> does not meet these criteria (no double).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How many different passwords</em> within the range given in your puzzle input meet these criteria?</p>
</article><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>An Elf just remembered one more important detail: the two adjacent matching digits <em>are not part of a larger group of matching digits</em>.</p>
<p>Given this additional criterion, but still ignoring the range rule, the following are now true:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>112233</code> meets these criteria because the digits never decrease and all repeated digits are exactly two digits long.</li>
<li><code>123<em>444</em></code> no longer meets the criteria (the repeated <code>44</code> is part of a larger group of <code>444</code>).</li>
<li><code>111122</code> meets the criteria (even though <code>1</code> is repeated more than twice, it still contains a double <code>22</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How many different passwords</em> within the range given in your puzzle input meet all of the criteria?</p>
